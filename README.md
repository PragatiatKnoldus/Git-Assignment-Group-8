## Topic :- GIT PUSH and PULL

### GIT PUSH :-  

The git push command is used to transfer or push the commit, which is made on a local branch in your computer to a remote repository like GitHub. Every time you push into the repository, it is updated with some interesting changes that you made. If we do not specify the location of a repository, then it will push to default location at origin master.

### GIT PULL :-

The pull command is used to access the changes (commits) from a remote repository to the local repository. It updates the local branches with the remote-tracking branches. Remote tracking branches are branches that have been set up to push and pull from the remote repository. Generally, it is a collection of the fetch and merges command. First, it fetches the changes from remote and combined them with the local repository.

### We created 4 different branches for every member with the following command :-
git checkout -b branch-name
  
#### We have created documentation for git push and pull and everyone has pushed there own documentation in their respective branches.
